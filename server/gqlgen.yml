# gqlgen Configuration
# This file tells gqlgen how to generate Go code from your GraphQL schema.

# Where to find the GraphQL schema
schema:
  - graph/*.graphql

# Where to put the generated code
exec:
  filename: graph/generated.go
  package: graph

# Where the models should be generated
model:
  filename: graph/model/models_gen.go
  package: model

# Where to put the resolver implementations
resolver:
  layout: follow-schema
  dir: graph
  package: graph
  filename_template: "{name}.resolvers.go"

# Map GraphQL types to existing Go types (so gqlgen doesn't regenerate them)
